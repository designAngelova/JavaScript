<!-- Write a JavaScript function biggerThanNeighbors(index,  arr) that accept a number
and an integer array as parameters. The function should return a Boolean number:
whether the element at the given position in the array is bigger than its two
neighbors (when such exist). It should return undefined when the index doesn't
exist. Write a JS program that invokes the function with the sample data below and
prints the result at the console -->
