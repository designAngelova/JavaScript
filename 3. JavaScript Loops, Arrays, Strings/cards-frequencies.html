<!-- Write a JavaScript function findCardFrequency(value) that that accepts the following
parameters: array of several cards (face + suit), separated by a space. The function
calculates and prints at the console the frequency of each card face in format "card_face ->
frequency". The frequency is calculated by the formula appearances / N and is expressed in
percentages with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point. The card faces with their frequency
should be printed in the order of the card face's first appearance in the input. The same
card can appear multiple times in the input, but its face should be listed only once in
the output. Write JS program cardFrequencies.js that invokes your function with the sample
input data below and prints the output at the console. -->
